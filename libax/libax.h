/*
** LIBAX, selfmade barebones network libary for HIVE Helsinki projects.
** More specifically the libary uses TCP protocol aka constantly alive
** connection. The reason for TCP is just that I happened to pick it and it
** started working so there's that.
** Libraries used technically not allowed but I will defend them with my life!
** Basically just a small fun project to see what it would require to do some
** kind of Network library in C. As it turns out it started working and I
** integrated it into the current HIVE project DoomNukem as both Network and
** Multiplayer bonuses.
*/

/*
** INCLUDES
** 2 types of includes: Windows and UNIX. Both are there as I often work
** from home and need the entire thing to work on my Windows PC.
** --WIN64--
** winsock2 and ws2tcpip are included for WIN network stuff and latter for
** TCP realted stuff.
** iphlpapi is included for resolving IP from given const char* and keep outlook
** same no matter on what OS the code is viewed.
** Pragma comments include the needed libaries.
** Windows also likes to be a different child so WSAEINTR is defined to EINTR
** to better keep compatability between systems.
** --UNIX--
** sys/socket is included for the basic network functions.
** sys/types is included for variables that other functions need.
** netinet/tcp is included for TCP variables
** errno is included to break recv under certain conditions.
** arpa/inet is defined for 'struct sockaddr_in' and IPPROTO_TCP.
** sys/fcntl is used to open and close the filehandling related to
** rending/receiving information
** INVALID_SOCKET and SOCKET_ERROR are defined on Windows and as the appropprate
** functions return -1 on UNIX we haave defined then as such
** Windows closes sockets with socketclose while UNIX with good 'ol close
** we "redirect" closesocket to close
